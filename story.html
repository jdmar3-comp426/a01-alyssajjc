            <p> There are many versions of this tale, but this is the one most familiar to me. A long time ago, the Jade Emperor called all animals to a meeting, and proclaimed that 
                the first twelve animals to arrive would be granted a place in the Zodiac. To reach this meeting, the animals had to cross a river. Cat and Rat were close friends
                then, and Cat, who always slept in late, asked Rat to wake her up early in the morning. However, when the day of the race arrived, Rat neglected to wake Cat, and went
                on to the river alone. Thus, Cat overslept and missed her chance to be in the Zodiac, and to this day, she still holds her grudge against Rat.</p>
            <p>At the river's bank, Rat realized that there was no way he could swim across. Fortunately, the kind-hearted Ox was also about to cross. Rat asked for a ride on Ox's 
                back, and Ox agreed and carried him across. However, as the pair neared the opposite shore, Rat leaped off ahead to reach the finish line first, taking the first spot
                in the Zodiac as Ox took the second. Soon after, the Tiger arrived at the finish line to take the third place after using her strength to power through the river's 
                currents.</p>
