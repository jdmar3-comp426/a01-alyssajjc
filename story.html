            <p> There are many versions of this tale, but this is the one most familiar to me. A long time ago, the Jade Emperor called all animals to a meeting, and proclaimed that
                 the first twelve animals to arrive would be granted a place in the Zodiac. To reach this meeting, the animals had to cross a river. Cat and Rat were close friends
                then, and Cat, who always slept in late, asked Rat to wake her up early in the morning. However, when the day of the race arrived, Rat neglected to wake Cat, and went
                on to the river alone. Thus, Cat overslept and missed her chance to be in the Zodiac, and to this day, she still holds her grudge against Rat.</p>
            <p>At the river's bank, Rat realized that there was no way he could swim across. Fortunately, the kind-hearted Ox was also about to cross. Rat asked for a ride on Ox's
                 back, and Ox agreed and carried him across. However, as the pair neared the opposite shore, Rat leaped off ahead to reach the finish line first, taking the first spot
                in the Zodiac as Ox took the second. Soon after, the Tiger arrived at the finish line to take the third place after using her strength to power through the river's
                 currents.</p>
            <p>Rabbit was next to arrive, claiming fourth place. He had hopped from rock to rock to cross the river, but fallen in halfway through. Fortunately, he had managed to grab on to a floating log
                 which drifted to the opposite shore. The Dragon was fifth to arrive, flying down from the clouds. The Jade Emperor wondered how it was possible that the mighty Dragon was not
                  first. Dragon explained that he had seen farmers struggling with drought as he flew, and had stopped to make rain to help their crops. Then, on his way to the finish line, he
                  saw a little Rabbit clinging to a log, and created a gust of wind to push him to shore. Thus, Dragon earned both the Jade Emperor's respect and the fifth place in the Zodiac.</p>
            <p>There came the sound of galloping as Horse raced towards the finish line. However, Snake was hidden on his hoof, and slithered ahead at the last moment. This startled
                 Horse, and Snake was able to cross the line before him. Thus, Snake and Horse claimed the sixth and seventh places in the Zodiac.</p>
            <p>A raft came ashore then, carrying the Goat, Monkey, and Rooster. Rooster had spotted an old raft in the weeds, and together the three animals had worked to move it
                to the river and paddle to the other shore. They peacefully crossed the finish line one by one. Goat was eighth, Monkey was ninth, and Rooster took the tenth place.</p>
            <p>The eleventh animal to arrive was Dog. Although he was a strong swimmer, his playful nature had gotten the better of him. He had forgotten all about the race while
                 playing in the river, and only remembered what he was supposed to be doing after seeing the raft landing on the opposite shore. A little while after, the twelfth and
                  final animal arrived: the Pig. Pig had also gotten distracted, stopping to eat and then have a nap before finally arriving to claim a place in the Zodiac. Thus, the
                   twelve animals of the Zodiac were decided.</p>
